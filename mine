  <h2>WEB</h2><br>
  <style="px=13">The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by<br> Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet.[1] English scientist Tim Berners-Lee<br> invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland.[2][3]<br> The Web browser was released outside of CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on<br> the Internet in August 1991.
